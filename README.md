# A-Prediction-algorithm-for-the-number-of-new-covid-cases-using-ANN

This New_Corona_Cases_prediction helps to guess the number of new corona cases in a particular country(I used India).

I Created a Neural Network that predicts the number of new covid cases with pair of 2 layers with 6 units

The dataset is downloaded from WHO site which contains features "Date_reported", "Country_code","Country","WHO_region","New_cases","Cumulative_cases","New_deaths",	 "Cumulative_deaths". I have extracted all data coresponding to INDIA.

The Dataset contains data from "MARCH 1st" to "SEPTEMBER 22nd".

The prediction is based on "month", "date", "new-cases".
